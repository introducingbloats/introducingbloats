# Introducing Bloats
Welcome to Introducing Bloats, the fucking bloats of nix flake packages, huge portion of these packages are automatically updated via cron(github actions), `nix flake update` is all you need.

## Goals
- Provide a really short timegap of new packages, and updates of existing packages.
- Use with NixOS, but also support other linux platforms(that has Nix) as much as possible.

## Non-goals
- MacOS (we dont have apple devices)
